        From the surreal landscapes of the Great Rann of Kutch, where the moonlit
        nights transform the salt flats into a shimmering expanse, to the colorful

        this destination offers an unforgettable experience. Explore ancient
        forts, such as Bhuj Fort and Lakhpat Fort, that tell stories of Kutch’s
        royal past, and witness intricate handicrafts brought to life by local
        artisans, famous for their embroidery, bandhani (tie-dye), and block
        printing.
