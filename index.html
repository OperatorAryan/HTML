    <!-- marquee tag was used to create scrolling text or images across the screen, 
    either horizontally or vertically
    It's important to note that the <marquee> tag is obsolete and is no longer supported in HTML5. 
    It's considered deprecated because it doesn't align with modern web standards, 
    and there are better ways to create scrolling effects using CSS or JavaScript.
     -->
